# Gesture Volume Control 🎛️✋

Control your computer’s volume using simple hand gestures, no physical buttons needed!

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This project uses your webcam to detect your hand and adjust your system volume based on the distance between your fingers. For example:
- Fingers close together → lower volume
- Fingers far apart → higher volume

It’s a fun way to explore computer vision and human-computer interaction.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Captures video from your webcam
- Detects hand landmarks using [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)
- Calculates the distance between your thumb and index finger
- Maps that distance to your system volume
- Updates the volume in real time

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- pycaw (on Windows) or appropriate audio libraries for your OS

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pycaw
(Replace pycaw with the correct library for your OS if you’re not on Windows.)
